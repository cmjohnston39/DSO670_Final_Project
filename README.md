# DSO670_Final_Project

This repo expands upon the experiments in [1] and was completed as a final project for DSO 670: Data-Driven Optimization: Theory, Methods, and Current Themes in November 2020.

Files are organized as follows:

main.ipynb -- Jupyter notebook that runs main experiments
non_DRO_methods.jl -- Julia file for calculating the non-DRO methods for the paper (baselines) -- Scarf, SAA, critical fractile
LRO.jl -- Julia file for implementation of LRO method defined in [1]. Utilizes JuMP and Ipopt
utils.jl -- Julia file for utility functions
